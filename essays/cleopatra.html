        <h1><i> Shakespeare’s Antony &amp; Cleopatra:</i> Cleopatra’s Racial Ambiguity &amp; Gender</h1>
        <h2>by Samantha Sasenarine, 2019</h2>
        <p class="indent">
            William Shakespeare&#39;s play, <i>Antony &amp; Cleopatra</i>, establishes a tragic love story that
            displays a &quot;long-standing, adulterous relationship&quot; (Greenblatt, 2775). While Shakespeare crafts
            two other popular love-stories during his career, <i>Romeo &amp; Juliet</i> and <i>Othello</i>, they are not as
            sophisticated as <i>Antony &amp; Cleopatra</i>, where the storyline mood shifts from &quot;romantic comedy&quot;
            to a complex &quot;portrayal of mature love&quot; (Greenblatt, 2775). <i>Antony &amp; Cleopatra</i> do exhibit
            maturity, but also flaws and mystery between characters. Exploring the play, we see there is a
            lack of open soliloquies from both Anthony and Cleopatra, which results in the audiences
            creating assumptions as to why characters may feel or perform certain ways in the play.
            Specifically, Cleopatra becomes an extraordinary female protagonist because Shakespeare
            constructs her as the queen of Egypt and infatuated with romance and power. Also, she becomes
            eccentric compared to other powerful women in Shakespearean plays because her identity
            constantly evolves throughout history (McMillian, 131). There are no comprehensive and solid
            ideas as to where we stand with Cleopatra&#39;s racial identity, and often, we are focused on her
            passion for Antony, which may dismiss the substantial value and power she holds in the play.
            Understanding the ambiguity of Cleopatra&#39;s racial identity and gender enables us to engage in
            discourse about how she innately performs as a powerful queen in her relationship with Antony
            while being exoticized and marginalized by other Roman men.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Analyzing the way Cleopatra&#39;s individuality shifts through history allows us to believe
          that her identity is opaque. Through performance, she is represented by both White and Black
          female characters on stage. Preferably, audiences desire and expect white actresses to play the
          role of Cleopatra, although it is offered to many Black women. Antiguan-born actress, Claire
          Benedict, was offered the role of Cleopatra in the 1993 RSC Production of the play after her co-
          star, Claire Higgins took ill. Initially, she was to perform as Charmian, one of Cleopatra&#39;s many
          servants (McMillan, 130). However, Benedict immediately received backlash for her
          performance, claiming many felt that it is necessary to &quot;tone down the cultural power&quot; of
          blackness. The complexity of Cleopatra&#39;s identity raises questions about how her &quot;ethnicity as an
          Egyptian has been contested historically.&quot; If the main role isn&#39;t being performed by a Black
          woman, often we see her servants, Charmian and Iras, being played by Black actresses, which
          display alternating ideas of Cleopatra&#39;s racial identity (McMillian, 131).
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Presenting the ambiguity of blackness in Cleopatra&#39;s identity cannot be voiced without
          thinking about how the Black identity is exemplified and concealed within whiteness during
          early modernism. Race is not a grounded idea during early modernism, but we must wonder &quot;to
          what extent this association influenced early race relations between white England and black
          Africa&quot; (Deroux, 89). English people &quot;formed notions of blackness&quot; based on &quot;color concept and
          physiology.&quot; Black bile and choler &quot;represented melancholy and wrath&quot; and linked blackness as
          vulnerable to evil. Black skin provoked ideas of negative qualities and racial stereotypes, such as
          having suspicious attitudes and unbridled emotions (Deroux, 91). Specifically, Black women
          tended to be labeled as designated &quot;subjects&quot; of European and masculine gazes, prized
          possessions, exotic &amp; oriental. Black women were also considered an &quot;ultimate accomplishment&quot;
          because they are categorized as &quot;otherness&quot; and became fascinating to men (MacDonald, 91).
          Kim Hall explains that people used “blackness” as a means of referring to someone of African
          descent rather than insinuating that an individual is solely “black” (Stephens, 1).
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Furthering how we think about blackness comparatively to Cleopatra, Shakespeare
          displays her as an exotic being in the play. Often, she and Egypt’s gifts are discussed as &quot;prized
          possessions&quot; by the Romans. He says, &quot;The beds i&#39;thi East are soft, and thanks to you/That called
          me timelier than my purpose hither/For I have gained by&#39;t/&quot; (2.6.50-52). Antony acknowledges
          that the &quot;beds&#39;&#39; are soft in the East, indicating the seductive nature of Egyptian
          people—demeaning their culture and way of life. Antony is grateful that Pompey gave him a
          reason to leave because he can now consolidate all that he has learned. He discusses the Nile,
          pyramids, and animals with the men as they ask him questions intriguingly:
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">ANTONY.</strong>
          Thus do they, sir: they take the flow o’ th’ Nile
          By certain scales i’ th’ Pyramid. They know
          By th’ height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
          Or foison follow. The higher Nilus swells,
          The more it promises; as it ebbs, the seedsman
          Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
          And shortly comes to harvest.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">LEPIDUS.</strong>
          You’ve strange serpents there?
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">ANTONY.</strong>
          Ay, Lepidus.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">LEPIDUS.</strong>
          Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by
          the operation of your sun. So is your crocodile (2.7.17-27)
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Even here, Antony is aware that he has &quot;gained&quot; from his relations with Cleopatra. He captivates
          the men by equating the pyramids and the Nile, explaining that marks on the pyramids &quot;expands&quot;
          the rise of the river. As the Nile water rises, farmers scatter their seeds on silt for the harvest.
          Lepidus proceeds to ask about &quot;strange serpents&quot; and crocodiles, protruding that he is
          enlightened by the conversation. During this discussion, men aren&#39;t directly conversing about
          Cleopatra as a woman with value, but rather as an exotic being reigning over Egypt. Cleopatra
          seems encompassed with Egypt&#39;s gifts, becoming a &quot;possession&quot; and forgotten as a powerful.
          The conversation progresses with Enobarbus mentioning that Antony will go back to his
          &quot;Egyptian dish,” indicating her presence as a “seductive object” (2.7.122). This makes us
          question Antony&#39;s genuine intentions to be with Cleopatra, but also how other white men view
          her. Rather than being discussed as a requited lover, she becomes a &quot;subject&quot; of Antony&#39;s
          motives. He becomes almost as an &quot;omniscient&quot; character, reporting to Roman officials about his
          discoveries while being with Cleopatra, giving them access to the land and its people.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Consequently, this may result in how Cleopatra performs as &quot;needful&quot; or &quot;dramatic&quot; in
          their relationship. Often, she asks for reassurance of Antony&#39;s love and expects a genuine
          response from him. She becomes an affectionate and upfront woman about her feelings, which
          allows us to think about the &quot;unbridled&quot; emotionality of blackness. The very beginning of the
          play expresses her need for security:
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">CLEOPATRA.</strong>
          If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">ANTONY.</strong>
          There’s beggary in the love that can be reckoned.
        </p>  
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">CLEOPATRA.</strong>
          I’ll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">ANTONY.</strong>
          Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth. (1.1.14-17)
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Cleopatra goes beyond and claims that if he doesn&#39;t love her, he should go back to Rome and be
          with his ex-wife Fulvia. She says, &quot;Let her not say &#39;tis I keep you here./I have no power upon
          you. Hers you are (1.3.22-23). Perhaps, Cleopatra is agitated from Anthony&#39;s &quot;baggage&quot; of
          having Fulvia and Octavia--who he secretly marries for political reasons--as wives. Also, the
          Romans deem her to be a &quot;whore&quot; constantly and undermine Cleopatra&#39;s abilities. Although
          Cleopatra is &quot;dramatic,&quot; we witness her perform as a woman with power that needs to establish
          herself as serious, especially in her intimate relationship and political role.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          The marginality of Cleopatra is unveiled throughout the play in several instances with
          Anthony. When he marries Octavia covertly, Cleopatra finds out and immediately starts
          comparing herself to her. Emotionally, she may feel embarrassed and shocked, especially when
          she references her insignificance to Octavia. She asks the messenger and Charmian about her
          bodily features:
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">CLEOPATRA.</strong> Is she as tall as me?
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">MESSENGER.</strong>
          She is not, madam.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">CLEOPATRA.</strong>
          Didst hear her speak? Is she shrill-tongued or low?
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">MESSENGER.</strong>
          Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">CLEOPATRA.</strong>
          That’s not so good. He cannot like her long.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <strong class="speaker">CHARMIAN.</strong>
          Like her? O Isis, ’tis impossible.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <span class="speak">CLEOPATRA. </span>
          I think so, Charmian—dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
          What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
          If ere thou look&#39;st on majesty.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          <span class="speaker">MESSENGER.</span>
          She creeps.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">Her motion and her station are as one.</p>
        <p class="indent">She shows a body rather than a life,</p>
        <p class="indent">A statue than a breather. (3.3.11-21)</p>
        <p>
          Instantly, we see similar patterns of Cleopatra trying to prove herself as a woman. She says that
          Octavia has a low pitched voice, &quot;dwarfish&quot; body, and dull. She is confident that Antony will not
          desire Octavia for too long because her bodily features won&#39;t pleasure him like hers. Anthony
          obscurely racializes Cleopatra in moments where he is angry with her. In Act 3, scene 13, he
          makes a clear distinction between Cleopatra and Octavia when he confronts her about turning
          away her battle ships. He says, &quot;Have I my pillow left unpresses in Rome/Forborne the getting of
          a lawful race/And by a gem of a woman, to be abused/By one that looks on feeders?&quot; (107-110).
          He not only insults Cleopatra by questioning himself for leaving Rome for her, but he refers to
          Octavia as someone &quot;of a lawful race&quot; and &quot;gem of a woman.&quot; He professes that Octavia is more
          of an honorable woman from a legitimate race compared to Cleopatra, belittling and placing her
          in the category of &quot;otherness.” As Cleopatra battles with her insecurities, Antony’s “male body
          remains pure, while the white female and black bodies compete for significance&quot; (Stephens,
          338). Here, Cleopatra is competing with whiteness, perhaps to ignore significant differences
          between herself and Octavia. However, it reveals how Cleopatra combats whiteness to feel like a
          beautiful woman with Antony. Antony stands in the outer circle where he is unaffected by his
          actions. He lavishes in the benefits of having a lover (Cleopatra) and forming political alliances
          with Octavia in Rome.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Now, let&#39;s examine the research about blackness in early modernism and how Black
            women are portrayed while focusing on the claims I make about Cleopatra in this play. Suppose
            we are to accept these claims about Cleopatra&#39;s racial identity and female role. If so, we can
            direct attention to the possibility that Cleopatra may be aware of her own racial difference
            between her and the Romans. She says, &quot;That am with Phoebus’ amorous pinches black/And
            wrinkled deep in time…&quot; (1.5.28-29). She makes a clear racial distinction about her skin,
            referring to it as &quot;pinches black&quot; (darkened) and &quot;wrinkled deep in time&quot; (perhaps aged by the
            sun). Also, she tends to be associated with Goddess Isis, who was interpreted to be a powerful
            woman with dark skin. Isis is &quot;the Earth or land of Egypt&quot; and &quot;Egyptian queens who identify
            themselves with her are worshipped as the mother of the world, capable of bringing order and
            wholeness of chaos and pain&quot; (Macdonald, 69). Cleopatra&#39;s loyal servants accredited her as Isis,
            which contributes to the renowned difference of race. Despite Cleopatra&#39;s praised as Goddess Isis
            for the Egyptian people, interestingly, Cleopatra&#39;s female role is often diminished by the
            Romans. Considering the claims raised about race, we can judge how sacred she becomes as an
            outspoken female character—although she tends to be thought of as an &quot;accomplishment&quot; or
            &quot;object&quot; of Antony’s. Her racial disparity and powerful female role expose us to how she clouds
            Antony&#39;s judgment &amp; manipulates him to actively commit to their relationship while presenting
            how admirable and legendary she is to her Egyptian people (Zink, 21).
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
          Antony and Cleopatra becomes interlaced in both love and political realms, which
          ultimately leads the characters to their tragic ending. This essay considered factors of
          &quot;difference&quot; being reasons behind the failure of their love story; however, culturally and
          politically, both characters embody two different parts of the world—East (Cleopatra) and West
          (Antony), which put them at odds from the very beginning. Although this representation of both
          characters work on a &quot;micro and macro level and helps unite the play thematically,&quot; focusing
          attention on Cleopatra’s racial ambiguity and gender allows us to see how Shakespeare crafts
          characters outside of whiteness (Zink, 20). Ultimately, these parts of Cleopatra’s identity enable
          us to look to how she embodies a woman in an obscure relationship and powerful queen of Egypt
          while combating the ill-treatment of other characters.
